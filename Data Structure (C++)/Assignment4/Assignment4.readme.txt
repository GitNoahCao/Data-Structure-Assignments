**In this Assignment, I used Linked List .There is a header file with the cpp file,I uploaded together. Make all will compile everything automatically.

**I hard code the filename,currently it read from sample1.txt. If user want to test other files just change the file name in the code.

**I use function head_insert(Node*&, int) to insert new number in the head of 2 lists.

**I set boolean found to false.

**while list1 isn't empty and found is false
	
	find biggest number of list1
	
   if biggest number of list1 is found in list2
		
       remove biggest number of list1
	
   else
		
   output biggest number of list1
		
   set found to true

   if found is false
   output "NONE"
